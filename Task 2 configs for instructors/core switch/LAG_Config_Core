LAG config (for core) :

   ---
* EXOS-VM.24 # enable sharing ?
  <port>          Master Port
* EXOS-VM.24 # enable sharing 4 grouping 4,5 ?
  <cr>            Execute the command
  health-check    link aggregation group handled by health-check application
  lacp            link aggregation group handled by LACP
* EXOS-VM.24 # enable sharing 4 grouping 4,5 lacp
Warning: Any config on the master port is lost (STP, IGMP Filter, IGMP Static Group, MAC-Security, CFM, etc.)

* EXOS-VM.25 # enable sharing 6 grouping 6,7 lacp
Warning: Any config on the master port is lost (STP, IGMP Filter, IGMP Static Group, MAC-Security, CFM, etc.)

* EXOS-VM.26 # configure vlan Radiology delete ports 4,5
* EXOS-VM.27 # configure vlan Clinical delete ports 6,7
* EXOS-VM.28 # configure vlan Radiology add ports 4 tagged

%% A number within the range of 1-4094 is expected.
* EXOS-VM.29 # configure vlan Clinical add ports 6 tagged
* EXOS-VM.30 # configure stpd s0 add vlan Radiology ports 4
* EXOS-VM.31 # configure stpd s0 add vlan Clinical ports 6
* EXOS-VM.32 # show sharing


Note : after enabling sharing and creating the group, you have to delete the ports out of the vlan then readd only the master port. 
Then you need to readd the master ports back to the stp domain.
